This lab consists of a “free-form” exercise: implement and test the <strong>Binary Search Algorithm</strong> as discussed in the lecture (lecture notes posted along with these instructions).




<strong>Exercise 1:</strong> Implement the Binary Search Algorithm. You are on your own except for the following few rules and guidelines:




<ol>

 <li>You may use your own <strong>h</strong> or the standard template library <strong>&lt;vector&gt;.</strong></li>

 <li>Your binary search implementation must be <strong>iterative</strong>, <u>not </u></li>

 <li>Binary search must be implemented as a <strong>function</strong>.</li>

 <li>You will implement <strong>your own main() </strong>function to test your binary search function.</li>

</ol>




<strong>Exercise 2:</strong> Modify your program from Exercise 1 so that it <strong>reports the search effort</strong> (in terms of number of equality checks of target against a vector value). Test.




<strong>Exercise 3:</strong> If there is time. Implement and test <strong>a recursive binary search function.</strong> Realize:  searching for a target in the “left half or “right half” is just another case of searching for a target in a linear arrangement of values. And: when you end up searching in a “half” that is so small that it is empty, you know that the target is not contained.







<strong>Credit for this lab:</strong> (1) Make sure to sign the <strong>signup sheet</strong>. (2) No other submissions are required, but keep your work for a follow-up exercise in the future (not the midterm).
